# Lab3 - Build Integrations


## 3.1 Builing your PyPi project with JFrogCLI

We have our sample PyPi project example docuemnted in a public [Github repo here](https://github.com/jfrog/project-examples/tree/master/python-example/pip-example)


## Overview
This example demonstrates how to build a Python Pip project with Artifactory, while collecting build-info.

## Before Running the Example
### Set Up the Environment
1. Make sure **Python** is installed and the **python** command is in your PATH.
2. Install **pip**. You can use the [Pip Documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and also [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
3. Create three Pypi repositories in Artifactory - a local, remote and a virtual repository. You can use the [PyPi Repositories Documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/PyPI+Repositories).
* The remote repository should proxy *https://files.pythonhosted.org* (the default when creating a Pypi remote repository).
* Name the virtual repository alpha-pypi-virtual
* The virtual repository should include the remote repository.
* The virtual repository should have the local repository set as the *Default Deployment Repository*.
## Hint
Uisng the quick Setup option, let us create a set of PyPi repositories which will be used in this lab

4. Make sure **wheel** and **setuptools** are installed. You can use the [Installing Packages Documentation](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).
5. Make sure version 1.28.0 or above of [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) is installed.

### Validate the Setup
In your terminal, validate that the following commands work.
```console
> source env/bin/activate
> pip install wheel
Output Python version:
> python --version

Output pip version:
> pip --version

Verify wheel is installed:
> wheel -h

Verify setuptools is installed:
> pip show setuptools

Verify that virtual-environment is activated:
> echo $VIRTUAL_ENV

Output JFrog CLI version:
> jf --version
```

## Running the Example
CD to the root project directory

```console
cd $SCRIPT_DIR/lab3-build_integration/pip-example
```

Configure the project's resolution repository. You shoud set the virtual repository you created.

Learn about [Building Python Packages with JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-BuildingPythonPackages)

```console
> jf pipc --server-id-resolve ${ARTIFACTORY_HOSTNAME} --repo-resolve alpha-pypi-virtual
```

Install project dependencies with pip from Artifactory:
```console
> jf pip install -r requirements.txt --build-name=my-pip-build --build-number=1 --module=jfrog-python-example
```

Package the project, create distribution archives (tar.gz and whl):
```console
> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Upload the packages to the pypi repository in Artifactory:
```
> jf rt u dist/ alpha-pypi-virtual/ --build-name=my-pip-build --build-number=1 --module=jfrog-python-example
```
Collect environment variables and add them to the build info:
```
> jf rt bce my-pip-build 1
jf rt bag my-pip-build 1 ../../.
```

Publish the build info to Artifactory:
```
> jf rt bp my-pip-build 1
```

Install published package by installing it from Artifactory using pip:
```
> jf pip install jfrog-python-example
```

Validate package successfully installed:
```
> pip show jfrog-python-example
```
```
> deactivate
```
